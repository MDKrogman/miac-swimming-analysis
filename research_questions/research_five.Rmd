5. If you were to create a random team with individuals from the MIAC, how good would they be as a whole?
  + The idea with this one is like the shiny app we worked with in class on Week 9 Monday.
  
- Just ideas for interactivity: checkboxes for what years rosters you want to include (filter out 24-25 premiac stuff first of all, makes no sense to include that)
- Select to pull from either men's or women's rosters (helpful for idea below)
- Include a fun little text object at the bottom of the page, using `points` from `miac_chpoints.csv` to say something like "The median team in this selection would be as good as x team from 20xx-20xy"

Alright that's all I got
